			<h2>What is this?</h2>
			<p>Halo: MCC has Campaign Playlists where you can play predefined missions from the six games in orders different to the actual campaigns, sometimes switching from one game to another.</p>
			<p>This website hijacks this feature to let you play randomly selected missions.</p>
			<p>This is at least the second randomizer written; <a href="https://randomizer.scal.es/">randomizer.scal.es</a> also exists, with a slightly different feature set, but more polish. Check that one out too.</a>

			<h2>How does this work?</h2>
			<p>In a normal MCC install, you can find <code>/Data/careerdb/missionplaylistdb.xml</code>. This file contains the default playlists and is surprisingly readable. This rando will generate a replacement file with the randomized playlists.</p>
			<p>For now, this completely removes every single playlist (you will get an error if you try to look at single-game playlists), and puts every random playlist in the Cross-game section of the menu. While this can be improved, it's very low priority.</p>

			<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
			<p>Tweak settings, press [Generate]<!-- TODO: there's markup for this isn't it-->, and download the file. You'll need to replace the default file, so be sure to either make a backup or remember to use the "Verify integrity of game files" function in Steam.<!-- TODO: double check how to do this with xbox launcher--></p>
			<p>You can generate multiple sets of playlists with different settings and names; until you refresh the page, it all gets added to the same <code>missionplaylistdb.xml</code>.</p>
			<p>Additionally, although I've not yet tested this, you should be able to play these in co-op without anti-cheat as long as all participants are using the exact same file.</p>

			<h2>What do the settings mean?</h2>
			<p><ul>
				<li>You can set the playlist name; this will be displayed in the menu.</li>
				<li>You can generate multiple playlists with the selected settings, each with the given mission count per playlist.</li>
				<li>By default, this excludes missions that don't include combat. The full list of excluded missions is as follows:
					<ul>
						<li>Halo 2: The Heretic (initial cutscene) and The Armory (tutorial and exposition).</li>
						<li>Halo 3: Arrival (initial cutscene) and Epilogue (ending cutscene).</li>
						<li>ODST: Prepare to Drop (initial cutscene) and Epilogue (ending cutscene).</li>
						<li>Reach: Noble Actual (initial cutscene), the credits cutscene, and Lone Wolf (final mission which ends on death).</li>
						<li>Halo 4: Prologue (initial cutscene) and Epilogue (ending cutscene).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>By default the rando cannot use the same mission twice in the same playlist. You can force allow duplicates, which unlocks silly things like very very long playlists, or <del>Halo Infinite: 2001 Edition</del> five consecutive runs of CE's Halo.</li>
				<li>You can select a difficulty for all missions of a given set. For example, you can generate 3 five-mission playlists in legendary, then 1 fifteen-mission playlist in normal.</li>
				<li>There's several skull modes.:
					<ul>
						<li>No skulls.</li>
						<li>Random each mission: each mission will have its own, randomized, set of skulls.</li>
						<li>Random, each mission adds more: each mission will have <em>at least</em> the skulls of the previous mission, plus a random chance at more.</li>
						<li>Enforce selected skulls: every mission will have the enabled skulls applied.</li>
					</ul>
					Any skull may be chosen for any mission. This includes skulls that aren't available for a given game. They will show up in the pause menu as enabled, but don't do anything.</li>
				<li>Each skull can be individually added or removed.</li>
				<li>You can choose to include only specific games in the pool.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All settings are saved in the URL, so you can save the permalink to your setup</p>

			<h2>Is this done?</h2>
			<p>Hell no! This is what I currently plan on adding, in rough order of priority:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Randomizing difficulty (so a single playlist can include multiple difficulties).</li>
				<li>Filtering specific missions instead of just games plus the cutscenes preset (expect "vehicular mayhem" presets, or "flood rando", or "floodless", like the default playlists).</li>
				<li>The Classic Rando Featureâ„¢: daily/weekly seeds!</li>
				<li>Rally points, maybe?</li>
				<li>Generate a missionplaylistdb that doesn't clobber the default playlists. Not really hard, just want to keep the xml files clean and readable until everything works 100%.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There's also a couple of MCC bugs that I'd need to work around, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>While having different skull sets per mission works, the game only notices when changing games or after saving and quitting.</li>
				<li>It seems like stuff gets a bit weird if the same mission appears multiple times in a row.</li>
				<li>Unless something's changed, Scales' randomizer also warns about changing difficulties.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The workaround for all three of these is the same code-wise.</p>
			<p>Additionally, there's a couple of longshot features that I'd like to add but aren't necessarily possible:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Spartan Ops. These should behave exactly like a campaign mission.</li>
				<li>Firefight. Limited in length, optionally with infinite lives (so you can't just skip it by dying five times as soon as it boots).</li>
				<li>Custom/modded campaign maps.</li>
			</ul>
